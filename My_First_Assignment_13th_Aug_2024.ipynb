    "#1. Explain the key featu$es of Python that makes it a popular choice for programminglanugauge ?\n",
    "\n",
    "#Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "It is Easy to Code and  a very high-level programming language which is easy to learn. \n",
    "Python code looks like simple English words hence easily understandable.\n",
    "It's Free and Open Source there by no need to pay licensing cost. \n",
    "Python has many libraries which is a very added advantage of using Python as we can easily write codes using these libraries. \n",
    "It is portable, extensible and embedded. We can write procedural, functional and object oriented programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Describe the role of predefined keywords in python and provide examples of how they are used in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Ans:-\n",
    "\tPredefined keywords are reserved words that have special meanings. These Keywords are used to define \n",
    "    the syntax of the coding. The Keyword can’t be Used as a variable name. All the Keywords are written in \n",
    "    lowercase except True and False\n",
    "    eg keywords , return, and, for , Ture , continue, lambda\n",
    "    for i in x:, if a==\"0\"  def abc():\n",

    "#3 Copare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in python with examples\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Objects can be classfied as mutable or immutable based on whether their state can be modifed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Mutable Objects can be changed after thier creation, This means we can modify the content without creating a new object.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Examples\n",
    "    List:\n",
    "    my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    my_list.append(4)  # Adding an element\n",
    "    print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "    my_list[0] = 10  # Modifying an element\n",
    "    print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "    Immutable Objects,  They can not be changed once they are created. Any modification \n",
    "    to an immutable object results in the creation of a new object. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example Strings, tuples and integers..\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example\n",
    "    \n",
    "     my_string =\" Hellow World\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "     my_tuple = (1,2,3)\n",

    "#4 Discuss the different type of operators in Python and provide examples of how they are used\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:- Operators are special symbols or keywords that are used to carry out specific actions\n",
    "    on numbers or variables in Python expressions. Python supports various types of operators, \n",
    "    including arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (==, !=, <, >),\n",
    "    logical operators (and, or, not), assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=), Bitwise operators Bitwise AND, NOR, NOT,XR.\n",
    "    Membership operators in , not in . identity operators is , not is\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for i in x:   if x not in (1,2,3):  \n",
    "            \n",
    "#5. Explain the concept of type casting in Python with examples\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans. Type casting, also referred to as type conversion, is the process of changing \n",
    "    one data type to another in Python. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Python provides built-in functions for type casting, such as int(), float(), str(), list(), tuple(), dict(), etc.\n",
    "    Type casting is often necessary for performing arithmetic operations, data manipulation,\n",
    "    and input/output operations in Python programs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    eg type(5) , type(\"Abc\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "#6. How do conditional statements work in python? illustrate with examples\n",
    "\n",
    "     Conditionals in Python are used to execute code based on the evaluation of one or more conditions.\n",
    "    Python supports conditional statements such as if, elif (else if), and else to control the flow of execution.\n",
    "    Conditionals can be nested to handle multiple conditions and control different branches of execution based on \n",
    "    the outcome of logical expressions.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        number = int(input('Enter a number: '))\n",
    "\n",
    "        # check if number is greater than 0\n",
    "        if number > 0:\n",
    "            print(f'{number} is a positive number.')\n",
    "        \n",

    "\n",
    "        if number > 0:\n",
    "            print('Positive number')\n",
    "        else:\n",

    "# 7 Describe the different types of loops in Python and their use case with examples\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans    \n",
    "        In Python, loops are employed to repeat a sequence of actions or code until a specific condition is fulfilled.\n",
    "        Python offers two primary types of loops: for loops and while loops. \n",
    "        “for” loops are used for iterating over a sequence of elements, \n",
    "        while “while” loops are used for executing code until a specified condition becomes False\n",
